# DesktopKillSwitch
An App that should be hosted on a Raspberry Pi to kill the electricity after shutdown of your PC

# Requirements  
* [DesktopKillSwitch-Client](https://github.com/getraid/DesktopKillSwitch-client)
* Raspberry Pi or other server, that is always running with a network connection.
* Running Node, NPM 
* Hue-Bridge with Hue compatible SmartPlug (In my case OSRAM Smart+ Plug )
* If you use something other than the OSRAM Smart+ Plug, you need a bit of knowledge about the Hue API. 

# Motivation / Idea  
Since a recent Windows update my machine started to boot itself up after some random hours or even minutes. I first thought it was magic packet that looped through the switch somehow. But it came so unexpectedly and every night, that I decided I'd use a more "traditional" approach (with like... killing the electricity... you know).  
So I bought myself this OSRAM Smart+ Plug, while it was on a discount and thought to myself: "I need to automate this on shutdown somehow."
And so here I am writing this script. For maybe you, who may be in the same situation. So yeah, you're welcome âœŒ
